## Description

J.A.T.E is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that runs in the browser, offline and can be installed locally to your machine. This application features a number of data persistence techniques, insuring the application runs regardless of browser supported function. J.A.T.E uses an IndexedDB database and the idb package. This application is deployed to Heroku.

## Installation

Please visit the deployed application at https://text-editor-cu-e0ae20bad742.herokuapp.com/. To then install, click the 'Install' button the top left of the screen which will prompt your browser to install the app.

## Usage

To use, just type text into the editor and hit enter to go to a new line. This will save it to your cache so you can come back to it later and the text will persist on the page even if you are offline.
